Work for the [NYSERDA Proptech Data Challenge](https://www.proptechchallenge.com/nyserda-tenant-energy-data)

## Problem Statements

1. What is your forecasted consumption across all 18 tenant usage meters for the 24 hours of 8/31/20 in 15 minute intervals (1728 predictions)?


2. How correlated are building-wide occupancy and tenant consumption?


3. What is the mean absolute error for your model?


4. What feature(s)/predictor(s) were most important in determining energy efficiency?


5. What is the most energy-efficient occupancy level as a percentage of max occupancy provided (i.e., occupancy on 2/10/20)?


6. What else, if anything, can be concluded from your model?

7. What other information, if any, would you need to better your model?
